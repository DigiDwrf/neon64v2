Architecture ideas:
- Data layout should be more intentional, to understand how things
  are colliding, e.g.:
  * Jump tables shouldn't be embedded in code, or should be organized
    as jumps instead of addresses (as in the opcode table).
  * The most important things could be in memory that never gets evicted
    (besides the register file). The biggest issue is dealing with the
    random access pattern of the NES ROM. It might be possible to spread
    that out to leave gaps in physical address space.
- Rework the scheduler so the CPU can run more than 1 instruction ahead,
  without having to yield constantly to allow other tasks to set interrupts.
- dlists should be generated on the RSP to send to the RDP. This will
  make some mid-frame effects easier.
- If I want expansion audio, the RSP scheduler needs to swap ucode, and/or
  I have to optimize for space.
- Text rendering should use the RSP+RDP rather than uncached writes
  on the CPU.

Missing features needed for better accuracy:
- Mid-frame palette changes
- Mid-scanline BG changes (MMC2, fine X scroll change, etc)
- BG-accurate SP0 hit
- Bug-accurate Sprite overflow
- Read of PPU activity
- Audio IRQs (frame counter, DMC)
- Palette deemphasis, greyscale
- Proper screen size for PAL
- Video signal parameters (slightly too narrow? starts too late?)

Desired features:
- Gameshark version
- Controller 2
- 4 player via Four Score
- PAL NES mode switch at runtime
- Proper text and profiling in PAL mode
- Remember PAL setting per-game
- Control remapping
- Arkanoid paddle
- Zapper
- Reset, power cycle
- PAL N64 mode
- Unofficial CPU opcodes
- Screenshots
- Famicom Disk System
- More mappers
- NSF player (with mapper 31 this is pretty close)
- Save to Controller Pak
- Savestate (Expansion Pak, persistent)
- Unlock framerate, fast-forward
- Some NES 2.0 support?

Desired mappers:
Easy
- 34 (Deadly Towers)
- 11 (Color Dreams)
- 66 (SMB+Duck Hunt)

- 111 (homebrew, memblers)

- 5 (MMC5, Castlevania 3, etc)
- 9 (MMC2, Punch-Out!!)
- 10 (MMC4, Fire Emblem, etc)
- 19 (Namco 129/163, Pac-Man Championship Edition, etc)
- 24 (VRC6a, Akumajou Densetsu)
- 25 (VRC6b, Madara etc)
- 64 (Tengen Rambo-1)
- 68 (After Burner)
- 69 (Sunsoft FME-7, Gimmick!, etc)

Known bugs:
- Streemerz uses a bad opcode (by design) after Faux logo
- Bill & Ted palette messes up when dialog boxes come up. - Needs mid-frame palette change (also Wizards & Warriors)
- Battletoads intro: a line of bad scroll (?) under the logo, during the quick
  pan the planet sometimes flashes into the upper screen (check hw?)
- Rad Racer - single lines out of place (check hw?)
- Jurassic Park - Ocean logo on the title screen seems to have a few lines out of place (check hw?)
- Pop when shooting sword in Zelda is irritatingly loud
- Some audio glitching in Mega Man 2 intro (check hw?)
- Black line over Kirby in pause screen - This is going to require better IRQ timing and maybe mid-scanline scroll
- Marble Madness garbled text - Needs mid-scanline pattern addr switch.
- Big Nose Freaks Out doesn't get in-game. Needs IRQ?
