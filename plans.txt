Architecture ideas:
- Data layout should be more intentional, to understand how things
  are colliding, e.g.:
  * Jump tables shouldn't be embedded in code, or should be organized
    as jumps instead of addresses (as in the opcode table).
  * The most important things could be in memory that never gets evicted
    (besides the register file). The biggest issue is dealing with the
    random access pattern of the NES ROM. It might be possible to spread
    that out to leave gaps in physical address space.
- Rework the scheduler so the CPU can run more than 1 instruction ahead,
  without having to yield constantly to allow other tasks to set interrupts.
- dlists should be generated on the RSP to send to the RDP. This will
  make some mid-frame effects easier.
- If I want expansion audio, the RSP scheduler needs to swap ucode, and/or
  I have to optimize for space.

Missing features needed for better accuracy:
- Mid-frame palette changes
- Mid-scanline fine X changes
- BG-accurate SP0 hit
- Bug-accurate Sprite overflow
- Read of PPU activity
- Audio IRQs (frame counter, DMC)
- Palette deemphasis, greyscale
- Proper screen size for PAL
- Video signal parameters (slightly too narrow? starts too late?)

Desired features:
- Gameshark version
- Controller 2
- 4 player via Four Score
- Proper text and profiling in PAL mode
- Remember PAL setting per-game
- Control remapping
- Arkanoid paddle
- Zapper
- Reset, power cycle
- PAL N64 mode
- Unofficial CPU opcodes
- Screenshots
- Famicom Disk System
- More mappers
- NSF player (with mapper 31 this is pretty close)
- Save to Controller Pak
- Savestate (Expansion Pak, persistent)
- Unlock framerate, fast-forward
- Some NES 2.0 support? (PAL, submapper, CHRRAM size, etc)

Desired mappers:
Easy
- 34 (Deadly Towers)
- 11 (Color Dreams)
- 66 (SMB+Duck Hunt)

- 111 (homebrew, memblers)

- 5 (MMC5, Castlevania 3, etc)
- 19 (Namco 129/163, Pac-Man Championship Edition, etc)
- 24 (VRC6a, Akumajou Densetsu)
- 25 (VRC6b, Madara etc)
- 64 (Tengen Rambo-1)
- 68 (After Burner)
- 69 (Sunsoft FME-7, Gimmick!, etc)

Known bugs:
- Menus and profiling are busted on non-PAL mode
- Bill & Ted palette messes up when dialog boxes come up. - Needs mid-frame palette change (also Wizards & Warriors)
- Rad Racer - single lines out of place (probably mid-line fine X), game over map is corrupt
- Jurassic Park - Ocean logo on the title screen has a few lines out of place, probably mid-line fine X
- Pop when shooting sword in Zelda is irritatingly loud
- Some audio glitching in Mega Man 2 intro (check hw?)
- Big Nose Freaks Out doesn't get in-game, needs DMC IRQ
- A line is out of place on the Mike Tyson's Punch Out title screen
- Aladdin bad opcode on startup
- Pirates! bad opcode on startup
- Half of Qix playfield is corrupt
- Nobunaga's Ambition title screen and in-game are messed up (check?)
- Bashi Bazook (proto) locks up on load, needs NES 2.0?
